# WhatsApp Ban & Enforcement System

This document explains how WhatsApp detects and handles account bans and restrictions, extracted from the WhatsApp APK source code. Knowing how this works helps you write bots that avoid triggering enforcement and handle enforcement events correctly.

---

## Overview

WhatsApp runs several independent enforcement systems:

| System                 | Trigger                               | Effect                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Account ban            | Policy violation detected server-side | Account permanently or temporarily suspended      |
| Spam warning           | Suspicious sending behavior           | Warning screen with countdown timer               |
| Reachout timelock      | Too many new-chat initiations         | Timed cooldown on starting new conversations      |
| Message capping        | Over-limit bulk messaging             | OTE request, send throttling                      |
| Heavy sender quota     | Broadcast list quota exceeded         | Broadcast list disabled until reset               |
| Gap enforcement        | Viewport-based content rules          | Chat-level content restrictions                   |
| Newsletter enforcement | Channel policy violations             | Channel suspension, geo-suspension, post deletion |

## Account Ban

### How bans are detected

Bans appear in HTTP responses from WhatsApp's registration and session endpoints. The client parses these fields from the JSON response body:

```json
{
  "violation_type": "spam",
  "violated_policy": "TERMS_OF_SERVICE",
  "violation_reason": "Sending unsolicited messages",
  "appeal_token": "WA|...",
  "source_acct": 1,
  "is_eu_smb": false,
  "version_upgrade": { ... },
  "custom_block_screen": { ... }
}
```

**Field reference:**

| Field                 | Type   | Meaning                                                     |
| --------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `violation_type`      | string | Category of violation (e.g. `"spam"`, `"automation"`)       |
| `violated_policy`     | string | The specific policy that was violated                       |
| `violation_reason`    | string | Human-readable explanation                                  |
| `appeal_token`        | string | `WA\|...` token used to submit the appeal                   |
| `source_acct`         | int    | Account source type (`-1` = unknown)                        |
| `is_eu_smb`           | bool   | Whether EU Small Business rules apply (affects appeal flow) |
| `version_upgrade`     | object | Present if ban is due to using an outdated app version      |
| `custom_block_screen` | object | Custom block screen data from WhatsApp's backend            |

The ban info is parsed in `KotlinRegistrationBridge` across multiple response handlers (`parseRegisterPhoneResponse`, `parseSameDeviceCheckResponse`, and others).

### Ban UI flow (from APK)

The ban system routes through `BanAppealActivity`, which hosts 7 screen states:

```
State 1 → BanInfoFragment         (initial ban screen — "your account has been banned")
State 2 → BanAppealFormFragment    (submit appeal form)
State 3 → BanAppealFormSubmitted   (appeal submitted confirmation)
State 4 → BanAppealUnbanned        (appeal approved — account restored)
State 5 → BanAppealBanned          (appeal rejected — account remains banned)
State 6 → BanAppealGuidanceFragment (education: what to do)
State 7 → BanAppealResponsibleUse  (responsible use guidelines)
```

The v2 flow (modern) uses `BanInfoFragment`, `BanAppealFormFragment`, etc.  
The legacy flow uses `LegacyBanInfoFragment`, `LegacyBanAppealFormFragment`, etc.

State `IN_REVIEW` is a special intermediate state shown while WhatsApp reviews the appeal.

### Appeal token in the library

Use `createEnforcementAppeal` to submit an appeal programmatically:

```js
// If you receive an appeal_token from the server, you can submit an appeal:
await sock.createEnforcementAppeal('false_positive', 'This account was incorrectly flagged')
```

The `appeal_token` from the ban response is the token used internally — it is passed as `appeal_request_token` in the intent extras to `BanAppealActivity`.

---

## Spam Warning

### What it is

A temporary warning screen with a countdown timer (not a permanent ban). The user can still use WhatsApp after dismissal.

### Trigger codes

From `SpamWarningActivity`, the warning reason is passed as an integer:

| Code | Meaning                        |
| ---- | ------------------------------ |
| 101  | General spam warning (type 1)  |
| 102  | General spam warning (type 2)  |
| 103  | General spam warning (type 3)  |
| 104  | General spam warning (type 4)  |
| 105  | Generic spam warning (default) |
| 106  | General spam warning (type 5)  |

### Key fields in the warning intent

```
spam_warning_reason_key   → int: reason code (see table above)
expiry_in_seconds         → int: how long the warning is shown (-1 = unknown/permanent)
spam_warning_message_key  → string: custom message text (server-defined)
faq_url_key               → string: URL to the WhatsApp spam FAQ
```

When `expiry_in_seconds != -1`, the APK shows a circular countdown progress bar. When the timer expires, the warning is dismissed automatically.

When `expiry_in_seconds == -1` (unknown expiry) and the user is in a special state (e.g. `A05 == 1`), the warning exits immediately with a redirect.

---

## Reachout Timelock (Error 463)

### What it is

A timed cooldown that prevents initiating new conversations. This is separate from a ban — the account still works, but the user cannot start new chats until the timelock expires.

### Timelock types

From `ReachoutTimelockInfoBottomSheet`, there are 20+ distinct timelock types (integer codes):

| Code range | Description                                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1          | Standard reachout timelock                                         |
| 3–17       | Various reachout restriction types (each has different UI strings) |
| 18         | Special type (uses feature flag 25042)                             |
| 20         | Alternate messaging restriction                                    |

Types 3–17 are "active" timelocks that display a circular countdown. Types 1, 18, 20 have different flows (no countdown, or immediate action).

### Timer mechanics

The timelock screen reads two timestamps:

- `TOwmL_end_time_in_ms` — when the lock expires (epoch ms)
- `TOwmL_start_time_in_ms` — when the lock started
- `TOwmL_type` — which type of lock (from the table above)

The circular progress bar shows time remaining. When `timeTillEnd <= 1000ms`, the timer completes and the UI transitions automatically.

### Library method

```js
// Remove an account reachout timelock (if the server allows it):
await sock.removeAccountReachoutTimelock()
```

---

## Message Capping (Bulk Message Limits)

### What it is

WhatsApp caps the number of messages a single account can send in a time window. When the cap is approached, the client sends an **OTE (Over-The-Envelope) request** to WhatsApp's servers to inform them.

### Network flow

`MessageCappingNetworkManager` sends a MEX mutation:

- **DataPath**: `xwa2_message_capping_ote_request`
- **Mutation**: `MessageCappingOteRequestMutation`
- **Schema**: `whatsapp-android-mex`
- **Input type**: `INDIVIDUAL_NEW_CHAT_THREAD`

The request includes:

- `reason_text` — human-readable reason for the OTE
- `selected_reason` — the specific reason code selected

The response is a `MessageCappingOteRequestMutation` result. On error, the error code and text are logged.

### Library method

```js
// Trigger a message capping OTE request:
await sock.messageCappingOteRequest()
```

This is normally called automatically by WhatsApp when approaching message limits. You can call it manually to check the current capping status.

---

## Heavy Sender Quota (Broadcast Lists)

### What it is

Broadcast lists (mass-send to multiple recipients at once) have a separate quota system. Accounts that send too many broadcasts are flagged as "heavy senders" and lose access to broadcast lists until the quota resets.

### Protocol flow

`BroadcastListQuotaProtocol` sends an IQ request on port 463 with a 32-second timeout. The response XML contains:

```xml
<limits>
  <messages_left>47</messages_left>
  <total_limit>256</total_limit>
  <is_heavy_sender>false</is_heavy_sender>
</limits>
<timeframe>
  <start_ts_s>1716825600</start_ts_s>
  <end_ts_s>1716912000</end_ts_s>
  <reset_ts_s>1716912000</reset_ts_s>
</timeframe>
```

### Quota fields

| Field                    | Meaning                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `limits.messages_left`   | Remaining broadcasts in this window       |
| `limits.total_limit`     | Total allowed broadcasts per window       |
| `limits.is_heavy_sender` | If `true`, broadcast access is restricted |
| `timeframe.start_ts_s`   | Window start (unix seconds)               |
| `timeframe.end_ts_s`     | Window end (unix seconds)                 |
| `timeframe.reset_ts_s`   | When quota resets (unix seconds)          |

### Error codes from the IQ response

| Error code    | Meaning                                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 400           | Bad request (type 3)                      |
| 401           | Unauthorized (type 4)                     |
| 403           | Forbidden / heavy sender blocked (type 5) |
| 500           | Server error (type 1)                     |
| No error code | Generic failure (type 0)                  |

## Gap Enforcement

### What it is

Gap enforcement checks content rules against viewport snapshots of the user's inbox. It controls visual placement: for example, certain chats cannot appear in the pinned area, and certain content types cannot appear at the top of the archived inbox.

### Architecture

`RulesManager` evaluates rules in three passes over the viewport:

1. Pass over `c730230x.A01` (primary rules list)
2. Pass over `c730230x.A03` (secondary rules list)
3. Pass over `c730230x.A02` (tertiary rules list)

Each pass applies `InterfaceC81803aO.ANC(rule, viewportSnapshot, coroutine)`.

### ViewPortSnapshot fields

```
inboxTop                   → list of chats at the top of inbox
pinnedInInbox              → int: number of pinned chats
topLockedInbox             → list of locked/restricted chats
topArchivedInbox           → list of top archived chats
lastMarketingMessageTimestamp → unix ms: last marketing message time
```

Gap enforcement is client-side only. It controls what appears where in the UI, not whether messages are delivered.

## Newsletter / Channel Enforcement

WhatsApp Channels have their own enforcement system, handled by `NewsletterEnforcementsClient`.

### Enforcement types

The `NewsletterEnforcements` MEX query (dataPath: `NewsletterEnforcements`) returns multiple lists:

- **Policy violations** — posts that violated a policy (with appeal options)
- **Status enforcements** — newsletter status changes (suspended, geo-suspended)
- **Violating messages** — specific messages that were removed

Each enforcement object contains:

- `violation_type` — `EnumC27075BvL` (policy type)
- `violation_status` — `EnumC27081BvS` (current status)
- `violation_reason` — `EnumC27073BvJ` (why)
- `appeal_deadline_ms` / `appeal_window_ms` — appeal time window
- `appeal_info` — who reviewed it, reviewer type
- `geo_restriction` — which countries are affected

### Appeal process

```js
// For newsletter appeals, use createEnforcementAppeal:
await sock.createEnforcementAppeal('dispute', 'This content does not violate any policy')
```

`NewsletterEnforcementsClient.A0A` sends a `CreateEnforcementAppeal` MEX mutation with:

- `entity_id` — the newsletter JID
- `enforcement_id` — the specific enforcement to appeal
- `appeal_reason` — primary reason
- `additional_appeal_reason` — secondary/additional context
- `locale` — user's locale

### Newsletter enforcement screens (from APK)

| Screen                   | Class                                          | Trigger              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Suspension info          | `NewsletterSuspensionInfoActivity`             | Newsletter suspended |
| Geo-suspension           | `NewsletterGeosuspensionInfoActivity`          | Geo-blocked          |
| Copyright suspension     | `NewsletterCopyrightSuspensionInfoActivity`    | DMCA/copyright       |
| Violating messages       | `NewsletterViolatingMessagesActivity`          | Posts removed        |
| Profile picture deletion | `NewsletterProfilePictureDeletionInfoActivity` | PFP removed          |
| Appeals outcome          | `NewsletterAppealsOutcomeActivity`             | Appeal result        |
| User reports             | `NewsletterUserReportsActivity`                | User report review   |

## What Triggers Bans (Inferred from APK Sources)

From the violation types and enforcement code, these behaviors are linked to enforcement actions:

**Account bans:**

- Sending unsolicited messages at high volume (violation_type: `spam`)
- Automated/bot behavior without authorization
- Policy violation (violated_policy: `TERMS_OF_SERVICE`)
- Using modified/third-party WhatsApp clients

**Spam warnings:**

- Sending the same message to many people quickly
- Being reported as spam by multiple recipients
- High message rate from a new account

**Reachout timelock:**

- Initiating too many new conversations (cold contacts) in a short period
- Messages to non-contacts being reported
- New account sending at high rate immediately after registration

**Heavy sender quota:**

- Broadcast list sends exceeding the daily/window limit
- Sending to broadcast lists with many recipients in quick succession
- `is_heavy_sender: true` response from the quota IQ

**Message capping:**

- Individual new-chat-thread volume too high
- OTE request triggers the cycle-based status reset

## How baron-baileys-v2 Handles Enforcement

The library's anti-ban system (`src/Socket/antiban.js`) includes:

- Rate limiting between messages
- Random delays to simulate human typing speed
- Jitter to avoid fixed-interval patterns
- Configurable burst limits

See [ANTIBAN.md](ANTIBAN.md) for the full anti-ban configuration.

The enforcement methods above let you react to actions the server reports. Use them to detect and recover from bans in long-running bots.
